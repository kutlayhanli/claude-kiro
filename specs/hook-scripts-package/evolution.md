# Evolution Record: hook-scripts-package

## Status: EVOLVED
**Date:** 2024-12-19
**Superseded By:** cli-init-hook-management
**Evolution Trigger:** Implementation revealed namespace pollution issue

## What Happened

During implementation of Tasks 1-7, we successfully created the Python package structure and hook modules. However, when testing the installed commands, we identified that having multiple `ckh-*` scripts (ckh-post-file-ops, ckh-pre-tool-validate, etc.) would pollute the global namespace as we add more hooks.

Through collaborative design discussion, we evolved to a better architecture using a single `ck` command that serves as the entry point for all Claude Kiro functionality.

## Preserved Components (Still Valid)

### Fully Implemented and Unchanged (Tasks 1-5):
- ✅ **Task 1:** Hooks module directory structure - All created and working
- ✅ **Task 2:** Cache manager utility - Complete with TTL and cleanup
- ✅ **Task 3:** Spec parser utility - Parses tasks.md and matches files
- ✅ **Task 4:** Session tracker utility - Prevents duplicate notifications
- ✅ **Task 5:** Main hook module (post_file_ops_spec_context.py) - Fully functional

### Architecture Preserved:
- All Python modules in `src/claude_kiro/hooks/` remain unchanged
- Shared utilities pattern (`_shared/` directory) proven successful
- Session-based notification tracking works perfectly
- JSON stdin/stdout protocol for Claude Code unchanged

## Superseded Components

### Changed Approach (Tasks 6-7):
- ❌ **Task 6:** Individual script entry points (`ckh-post-file-ops`)
  - **Old:** Multiple `ckh-*` commands
  - **New:** Single `ck --hook <name>` command

- ❌ **Task 7:** Installation testing focused on individual scripts
  - **Old:** Test each `ckh-*` command
  - **New:** Test unified `ck` command

### Needs Updating (Tasks 8-9):
- ⚠️ **Task 8:** Documentation must reflect new CLI approach
- ⚠️ **Task 9:** Migration focuses on settings.json command change

## Migration Path

See: `specs/cli-init-hook-management/` for the evolved design that:
- Uses all hook modules as-is
- Provides single `ck` command entry point
- Adds `ck init` for project setup
- Bundles resources in package for offline use

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well:
1. **Modular design** - Clean separation of concerns made evolution easy
2. **Shared utilities** - Reusable components (cache, session, parser) proven valuable
3. **Test-driven approach** - Early testing revealed the namespace issue

### Key Insights:
1. **Namespace pollution** - Multiple global commands don't scale well
2. **Single entry point** - `ck` command provides better UX and discovery
3. **Resource bundling** - Including .md files in package enables offline operation
4. **Evolution is normal** - Discovering better approaches during implementation is expected

### Technical Discoveries:
- `uv tool install` makes single command (`ck`) cleaner than multiple scripts
- Click's subcommand pattern perfect for extensible CLI
- `importlib.resources` ideal for bundling configuration files

## Code Metrics

### What Was Built:
- **Lines of Code:** ~500 lines of Python
- **Modules Created:** 6 Python files
- **Test Coverage:** Manual testing completed
- **Time Invested:** ~4 hours

### Reusability:
- **100% of hook implementation preserved**
- **0% throwaway code** - Everything reused in new architecture

## Future Considerations

The evolution to CLI architecture opens possibilities for:
- Additional hooks without namespace pollution
- Spec management commands (`ck spec list`, etc.)
- Configuration management (`ck config`)
- Template generation (`ck template`)

All while maintaining the clean single `ck` entry point.
